# RasterTD

A physics-based tower defense game. RasterTD reuses some systems from the earlier
project *Equatoria Idle* (particle simulation, rendering, save/load), but much of
the idle-game content is being removed and reworked around tower-defense gameplay.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Development server on http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # Production build to dist/
npm run typecheck # TypeScript type checking
```


## GitHub Pages Deployment

This repository is configured to deploy automatically to **GitHub Pages** with GitHub Actions.

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- Trigger: pushes to `main` (or manual run from Actions tab)
- Build output: `dist/`

The Vite `base` path is resolved automatically in GitHub Actions from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, so assets load correctly from the repository pages URL (`https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`).

## How to Play

1. **Tap the equation** on the canvas to earn motes
2. **Purchase upgrades** to increase motes per tap for each colour tier
3. **Unlock new tiers** as you accumulate enough resources
4. **Auto-tap** and **multiplier** upgrades accelerate your progress
