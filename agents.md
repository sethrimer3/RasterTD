# AI Agent Guidelines for Equatoria Idle

This document defines the required standards for AI coding agents working on the Equatoria Idle repository.

The project is a mobile-first idle game written in **HTML + CSS + TypeScript**. It uses a **low native internal resolution** that is then upscaled for display, creating a slightly pixelated look while preserving crisp UI and readable math notation. The game must work well on both **mobile and desktop**, in both **portrait and landscape**, with responsive layouts and clean scaling behavior.

The core gameplay has two major simulation pillars:

1. **Equation progression**
   - The player upgrades visible parts of a mathematical equation on screen
   - Tapping the equation and automated systems generate resources
   - Equation segments are color-tiered and become progressively more complex

2. **Gem particle simulation**
   - Taps emit gem-like particles
   - Particles move visually through the scene, bounce, trail, and get drawn into a forge
   - The forge refines them into actual resources called **Motes**

These guidelines exist to protect:
- correctness
- performance
- readability
- maintainability
- visual consistency
- clean separation of responsibilities

---

## 1. Core Architectural Rule: Hard Separation of Systems

The repository must maintain a strong separation between the following layers:

- **sim/**: game rules, resource generation, progression logic, timers, unlocks
- **render/**: canvas rendering, visual particles, trails, equation display, screen effects
- **ui/**: DOM-based menus, buttons, tabs, overlays, settings panels
- **input/**: tap, click, drag, keyboard, gesture translation into actions
- **audio/**: sound and music playback only
- **data/**: upgrade definitions, color tiers, formulas, balancing constants
- **math-render/** or equivalent: formula formatting, expression layout, notation helpers
- **app/** or root orchestration layer: bootstrapping, screen lifecycle, wiring systems together

### Non-negotiable rules
- `sim/` must not depend on DOM APIs
- `sim/` must not depend on rendering code
- `sim/` must not depend on CSS, layout state, or audio
- `render/` must not mutate authoritative simulation state
- `ui/` must not contain core progression logic
- `input/` must translate player intent into actions, not directly rewrite arbitrary game state

Keep game logic independent from presentation whenever reasonably possible.

---

## 2. Platform and Product Priorities

Equatoria Idle is **mobile-first**, but must also feel good on desktop.

### Required priorities
1. **Mobile usability first**
2. **Responsive layout across aspect ratios**
3. **Crisp low-resolution visual identity**
4. **Readable mathematical expressions**
5. **Smooth performance on modest hardware**
6. **Clear agent-written code that future agents can safely extend**

### Practical implications
- UI must scale cleanly on phones and tablets
- Bottom tab navigation must always remain comfortable to tap
- Important controls must never rely on hover
- Desktop should support mouse input naturally without becoming a separate code path unless necessary
- Portrait and landscape should both function without layout breakage

---

## 3. Visual Scaling and Pixel Rendering Rules

The game renders at a **lower internal resolution** and is then upscaled. The upscale factor may effectively appear like 2x, 3x, 4x, or similar depending on platform and viewport.

### Rules
- Treat the internal game resolution as a deliberate artistic coordinate space
- Preserve crisp scaling whenever possible
- Avoid blurry canvas presentation unless explicitly desired for a specific effect
- Keep pixel-style visuals stable across resize events
- Do not mix “pixel world rendering” and “high-DPI UI rendering” carelessly

### Recommended approach
- Render the main simulation to a low-resolution canvas or internal surface
- Upscale the simulation output for display
- Keep DOM UI readable and responsive at device resolution
- If separate rendering layers are used, clearly distinguish:
  - low-resolution simulation visuals
  - high-resolution UI overlays

### Do not
- hardcode layout around one phone size
- assume landscape only
- let equation text become blurry due to careless CSS scaling
- stretch the canvas independently in X and Y unless that is a deliberate, documented choice

---

## 4. Math Rendering Is a First-Class System

The equation is the centerpiece of the game. It must be visually clean, understandable, and extensible.

### Requirements
- Equation rendering must be treated as a dedicated concern, not an afterthought
- Expressions must remain legible on small screens
- Color-coded segments must be consistent and semantically meaningful
- Layout must handle increasingly complex expressions without collapsing into unreadable clutter

### Agent rules
- Prefer structured expression models over ad hoc string concatenation for complex formulas
- Separate:
  - expression data
  - formatting logic
  - visual rendering logic
- Build with future complexity in mind:
  - addition
  - multiplication
  - exponents
  - function notation
  - nested expressions
  - secret late-game tiers

### Recommended model
Represent equations as structured expression trees or typed segments rather than raw strings where possible.

Example conceptual types:
- `ConstantExpression`
- `BinaryExpression`
- `PowerExpression`
- `FunctionExpression`
- `TierSegment`
- `EquationViewModel`

This improves readability, extensibility, testing, and color-tier rendering.

---

## 5. Color Tier System Rules

The equation uses a rainbow-style progression with 7 visible tiers and secret 8th and 9th tiers.

### Requirements
- Tier identity must be consistent across:
  - equation rendering
  - resources
  - upgrades
  - particles
  - Mote refinement
  - UI indicators
- Tier order must be treated as canonical
- Avoid magic strings repeated throughout the codebase

### Define a single source of truth
Use one canonical data definition for tiers, such as:
- id
- displayName
- color
- unlockOrder
- visibility
- associated resource type
- associated equation role

### Do not
- scatter tier colors across unrelated files
- encode tier logic only in UI text
- hardcode special cases in several places without documenting them

---

## 6. Resource Model and Progression Rules

Current working terminology:
- raw emitted gem particles are visual carriers
- refined resources are called **Motes**
- total score is based on the combined refined resources across colors

### Design expectations
Agents must preserve a clean distinction between:
- visual particle entities
- raw collectible or transit state
- refined Mote totals
- score computation
- unlock and upgrade effects

### Rules
- Do not make visual particles themselves the sole source of truth for economic state unless explicitly designed that way
- Keep authoritative resource totals in simulation state
- Treat score calculations as deterministic and inspectable
- Avoid hidden side effects in UI or rendering code

### Important
Because the total score is the product of tiered refined resources, scaling can become extreme. Agents must implement number systems carefully and document their approach.

Possible approaches:
- big number library
- custom scientific notation layer
- logarithmic helper model for display and comparisons

Whichever approach is used, document it in `DECISIONS.md`.

---

## 7. Particle Simulation Rules

Gem particles are important visually and thematically, but must not compromise performance or code clarity.

### Particle expectations
- emitted when equation is tapped or auto-triggered
- move through the scene
- leave trails
- bounce off boundaries and relevant objects
- can be drawn toward the forge
- visually reinforce resource generation

### Required separation
If practical, distinguish between:
- **authoritative gameplay state**
- **visual particle representation**

Not every screen particle needs to be authoritative simulation state. Agents should choose the lightest architecture that preserves intended gameplay behavior.

### Performance rules
- avoid per-frame garbage in hot loops
- pool particle objects or use packed arrays where helpful
- avoid frequent allocation of trail arrays in active paths
- precompute repeated values where reasonable
- use explicit lifecycle management for particles

### Do not
- create hundreds of new objects every frame in core loops
- use expensive DOM operations for particle motion
- tie particle counts directly to unbounded late-game resource values without caps, batching, or abstraction

---

## 8. UI and Responsive Layout Rules

The game has three bottom tabs:
1. Equation simulation and equation upgrades
2. Resources and special upgrades
3. Settings, credits, visual options, sound options, Discord invitation

### Requirements
- Bottom navigation must remain clear and tappable on phones
- Layout must adapt gracefully to portrait and landscape
- Menus and buttons must scale cleanly to screen size
- Important gameplay information must remain accessible without awkward nesting

### Agent rules
- Use responsive layout systems, not brittle pixel-perfect DOM assumptions
- Prefer CSS variables, layout tokens, and reusable component classes
- Preserve large tap targets
- Avoid hover-only interactions
- Keep tab state management centralized and predictable

### Do not
- bury important gameplay actions inside too many modal layers
- hardcode fixed widths for mobile panels
- create separate disconnected UI systems for mobile and desktop unless necessary

---

## 9. TypeScript Standards

This repository is **TypeScript-first**.

### Rules
- Use strict typing
- Avoid implicit `any`
- Keep core models and APIs strongly typed
- Prefer explicit interfaces and discriminated unions where they improve safety
- Use small, well-named types instead of giant ambiguous objects

### Strongly recommended
- typed upgrade definitions
- typed resource identifiers
- typed tier identifiers
- typed screen/tab identifiers
- typed action/event payloads

### Do not
- use `any` as a shortcut in core gameplay code
- pass large untyped blobs between systems
- rely on fragile string comparisons when a union type would be safer

---

## 10. Naming Conventions

Naming must be consistent and precise.

### General rules
- State uses nouns: `score`, `moteTotals`, `equationState`, `forgeState`
- Actions use verbs: `tapEquation`, `refineMotes`, `unlockTier`, `spawnParticle`
- Boolean names start with:
  - `is`
  - `has`
  - `can`
  - `should`
  - `needs`

Examples:
- `isUnlocked`
- `hasForgeAccess`
- `canAffordUpgrade`
- `shouldShowSecretTier`
- `needsLayoutRefresh`

### Counts, IDs, and indices
- counts end with `Count`
- indices end with `Index`
- IDs end with `Id`

Examples:
- `particleCount`
- `tierIndex`
- `upgradeId`

### Units and spaces
Any value with units should include a suffix where relevant.

Examples:
- `elapsedMs`
- `tickCount`
- `positionPx`
- `velocityPxPerSec`
- `radiusPx`

For coordinate spaces, use explicit suffixes:
- `Screen`
- `Canvas`
- `World`
- `Ui`

Examples:
- `pointerScreen`
- `forgeCenterCanvas`
- `particleWorld`

### Mutable vs readonly models
- mutable state objects end with `State`
- derived or readonly versions end with `View`, `Snapshot`, or `Model`

Examples:
- `EquationState`
- `ForgeState`
- `EquationViewModel`
- `ResourceSnapshot`

---

## 11. Keep Files Small and Legible

Agents must keep files reasonably small and focused.

### Guideline
- Prefer files under roughly **1000 lines**
- Much smaller is better when practical
- Split earlier rather than later if a file is becoming hard to reason about

### Preferred organization
- one major concern per file
- helper modules for formatting or math utilities
- data definitions separated from rendering and simulation
- no giant “everything” files

### When splitting files
- preserve behavior unless intentional changes are requested
- keep naming stable where possible
- update imports cleanly
- document structure changes in `file_index.md`

---

## 12. Required File Indexing

To help future AI agents, maintain a `file_index.md` and keep it current.

### Purpose
This file should briefly summarize:
- what each important file does
- key exported functions/classes
- major sections inside long files
- notable performance-sensitive areas
- known extension points

### Suggested style
For each important file:
- path
- purpose
- major exports
- line-range style section summary when useful

Example:
- `src/sim/equation/equation-state.ts`
  - stores authoritative equation progression state
  - exports `createEquationState`, `applyEquationUpgrade`
  - lines 20–80: state model
  - lines 81–160: upgrade application
  - lines 161–220: derived tap value calculation

Keep this concise and accurate.

---

## 13. Hot-Path Performance Rules

Even though this is an idle game, performance still matters because:
- particle counts may grow
- mobile devices are a priority
- UI and rendering must stay smooth
- late-game activity can become visually dense

### Rules
- avoid hidden allocations in per-frame code
- avoid repeated array recreation in hot loops
- avoid unnecessary closures in high-frequency paths
- prefer simple loops over abstraction-heavy patterns in hot code
- use pooling where particle counts justify it

### Measure what matters
When performance-sensitive changes are made, verify:
- frame stability
- particle update cost
- layout thrashing avoidance
- resize performance
- idle background behavior on mobile

### Do not
- over-engineer micro-optimizations in cold code
- ignore obvious garbage-heavy loops in rendering and particle systems

---

## 14. Game Loop and Time Rules

Agents must keep time handling clear and consistent.

### Rules
- Prefer a single authoritative update loop
- Distinguish clearly between:
  - simulation step timing
  - render timing
  - UI animation timing
- Use named time units consistently
- Clamp or handle large time gaps safely after tab switching or device sleep

### Important idle-game concern
The game may eventually include offline or background progress. If that is implemented:
- document the model clearly
- keep the logic deterministic and inspectable
- separate offline progression calculation from frame-by-frame visual simulation

Do not quietly fake economic state in rendering code.

---

## 15. State Management Rules

Keep game state explicit and predictable.

### Requirements
Separate at minimum:
- progression state
- equation state
- resource state
- particle visual state
- UI state
- settings state

### Rules
- avoid one giant mutable global object unless clearly structured and justified
- keep ownership of each state area clear
- write state transitions in obvious places
- prefer named functions for important mutations

Examples:
- `applyTapToEquation`
- `applyAutomationTick`
- `refineParticlesIntoMotes`
- `setActiveTab`
- `setVisualScaleMode`

---

## 16. Settings and User Preferences

The settings tab includes:
- color theme
- visual settings
- sound settings
- credits
- Discord invitation

### Rules
- settings must be centralized
- defaults must be explicit
- persisted settings must be version-tolerant where possible
- visual settings must not silently break readability or performance

### Recommended examples
- pixel scale preference
- reduced particles mode
- trail intensity
- screen shake on/off
- sound/music volume
- color theme preset
- accessibility-oriented contrast settings if added later

---

## 17. Documentation Requirements

Maintain these files and keep them current:

### `ARCHITECTURE.md`
Describe:
- main runtime flow
- system boundaries
- state ownership
- equation rendering pipeline
- particle rendering pipeline
- UI structure
- resize/scaling strategy

### `DECISIONS.md`
Document important technical decisions such as:
- internal render resolution strategy
- math notation rendering approach
- big-number strategy
- particle authority model
- save format strategy
- offline progress model
- canvas/UI layering approach

### `manual_test_checklist.md`
Include manual checks for:
- tap responsiveness
- equation rendering readability
- portrait and landscape layout
- tab switching
- settings persistence
- particle performance
- forge behavior
- upgrade purchasing
- late-game scaling sanity
- desktop mouse support
- mobile touch support

### `file_index.md`
Keep file-level summaries for agent navigation.

---

## 18. Save Data and Persistence Rules

Idle games depend on trustworthy save behavior.

### Requirements
- save data must be versioned
- migration logic must be explicit if structure changes
- do not silently destroy old saves
- keep saved state minimal but complete

### Rules
- separate transient visual state from persistent progression state
- do not persist unnecessary particle visuals unless there is a strong reason
- document save format changes in `DECISIONS.md` or a changelog entry

---

## 19. Workflow for AI Agents

### Before making changes
1. Read the relevant files fully
2. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `file_index.md`
3. Identify the system boundary you are changing
4. Preserve existing patterns unless there is a clear reason to improve them

### While making changes
- keep code focused and typed
- maintain system separation
- avoid mixing simulation and presentation concerns
- update nearby docs when structure changes
- prefer clarity over cleverness

### After making changes
- verify the app still runs on both mobile-style and desktop-style layouts
- verify no obvious regressions in equation readability
- verify no avoidable performance regressions
- update `file_index.md` if file responsibilities changed
- update `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `DECISIONS.md` if the technical approach changed
- increment build/version metadata if the repository uses it

---

## 20. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Do not:
- blur the equation through careless scaling
- bury core logic inside DOM event handlers
- represent complex expressions only as ad hoc strings
- mix visual particle effects with authoritative economy state without documentation
- hardcode tier colors in multiple places
- build layout around one phone resolution
- create giant monolithic files
- use weak typing in core progression logic
- create garbage-heavy particle loops
- let mobile usability become an afterthought
- add “temporary” hacks without documenting them

---

## 21. Equation Upgrade System Guidance

Because the equation is the heart of the game, its upgrade system must remain extensible.

### Agents should build for progression such as:
- additive terms
- tap strength increases
- automation timing reductions
- multiplicative terms
- exponent systems
- functions
- nested subexpressions
- late-game special mechanics

### Strong recommendation
Design upgrades around data and effect application rather than giant conditional trees.

Prefer patterns like:
- upgrade definitions
- effect descriptors
- typed application functions
- derived equation builders

This makes balancing and expansion much easier.

---

## 22. Suggested Repository Structure
